# OpenSDS Northbound Plugin Project

## Introduction

The SUSHI Project is an umbrella project for all the [OpenSDS Project](https://opensds.io/)
NorthBound Plugins, for OpenStack, Kubernetes, Mesos, VMware and more.
The plugins themselves could have multiple hosting location,
however the OpenSDS Sushi Project repo should always have the most up-to-date version.

Sushi will also seek to collaborate with other upstream open source communities
such as Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Docker, OpenStack, and Open Container Initiative.

## Introduction

SODA API is an open source implementation of SODA API Standards for Data and Storage Management. The effort is to provide a common unified data and storage interface to store, run any data anywhere. It is part of SODA Terra (SDS Controller). There are other two repositories part of SODA Terra viz., [Controller](https://github.com/sodafoundation/controller) and [Dock](https://github.com/sodafoundation/dock)

This project implements the API Server, Different API services, utilities and more. The implementation will be based on the API standards from The SODA Foundation.

It connects the application or client to the storage backends to do data/storage management seamlessly providing a platform and storage agnostic framework.

Any application or client platform can implement the interface using the API specification to connect to API or implement northbound plugins to bridge their specifications to SODA API.

Currently we support block and file APIs for key features of data management (provisioning, migration, fileshare, etc). for on-prem implementation

This is one of the SODA Core Projects and is maintained by SODA Foundation directly.

## Project Roadmap

SODA API Standards working with standard bodies and industry partners. Build a scalable microservice based API layer to support data store with file, block and object operations across edge, core/on-prem and cloud.
